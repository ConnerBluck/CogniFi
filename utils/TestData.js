Retirement, Living Comfortably, Feeling Financially Secure, Maximizing wealth.    The typical advice is that you should aim to replace 70% to 90% of your annual pre-retirement income through savings and Social Security. For example, a retiree who earns an average of $63,000 per year before retirement should expect to need $44,000 to $57,000 per year in retirement.

Assets: Cash, T-Bills, Money Market Accounts   Avg. Annual return: 0-2%      **Investing**   Objectives: The process of putting your money to work over the long-term, by buying and holding assets that will grow from compound interest   Assets: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, Property   Avg. Annual return: 6-10%      However, investment comes with risk.       In the short term, saving and investing don’t look that different in terms of returns. But in the long run investing uses the power of compound interest to provide far superior returns.   **Compound Interest**   Compound interest (or compounding interest) is interest calculated on the initial principal, which also includes all of the accumulated interest from previous periods on a deposit or loan.   Compound interest is calculated by multiplying the initial principal amount by one plus the annual interest rate raised to the number of compound periods minus one.   The formula for calculating compound interest is:     *   Compound interest = total amount of principal and interest in future (or future value) _less_ principal amount at present (or present value)           **_= [P (1 + i)<sup>n</sup>] – P_**            **_= P [(1 + i)<sup>n </sup>– 1]_**            Where:            _P = principal_            _i = nominal annual interest rate in percentage terms_            _n = number of compounding periods_          **Quiz**      1.

This essentially means an investment vehicle is a place for investors to put their money in the hopes that the money grows over time. An example of this would be someone buying a stock in a company, hoping that stock will grow in value. In this example, the stock is the investment vehicle. The investment vehicle refers to the method an individual or business uses to invest, and they come in many different forms.    **Types of Investment vehicles**   There are many different types of investment vehicles but that can all be categorized under two broad categories: direct and indirect investments.   **Direct Investments:**   Direct investments are specific asset holdings or securities that generate an investment return. Direct investments do not have to have professional portfolio management. The investment or asset is completely controlled by the investor. Some examples of direct investments would be stocks, bonds, or rental real estate.   **Indirect Investment:**   Indirect investments are investment vehicles that hold direct investments selected by professional portfolio managers. Investors usually pay portfolio managers a management fee to choose and monitor direct investments for them. Some examples of indirect investments are Mutual Funds, Hedge Funds, and Exchange-traded funds (ETF).      Some other investment types of investment vehicles are pooled investment vehicles, public investment vehicles, and private investment vehicles.      **Pooled Investment Vehicles:**   Pooled investment vehicles are the most common type of indirect investment and are created and led by sponsors such as Vanguard and Fidelity. The sponsor retains a portfolio management team to select direct investments to be held in pooled vehicles. Shareholders of the pooled investment vehicle own the vehicle itself, rather than directly owning the direct investments. This means they pool their money together into a diversified portfolio that is managed by professionals. This method of investing is generally seen as less of a risk compared to most other forms of investing.   **Public Investment Vehicles:**   Public investment vehicles are vehicles that can be purchased by the general public. They are usually purchased through some brokerage firm that acts as a middleman. Some examples of public investment vehicles are ETFs or closed-end funds.   **Private Investment Vehicles:**   Private investment vehicles are not available to the general public. In order to invest in private investment vehicles, people typically need to meet certain requirements, such as meeting income or net worth thresholds. Some examples of private investment vehicles are hedge funds and venture capital. ",
